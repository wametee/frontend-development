# Learning Plan to Become a Frontend Architect

Aspiring to become a frontend architect? Follow this structured learning plan to master the essential skills and concepts needed for this advanced role. 

## Topics to Learn

1. **Micro Frontend Architecture**
   - Modularize large applications by breaking them into smaller, independently deployable components. This approach allows distinct teams to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.

2. **Web Vitals Optimization**
   - Focus on optimizing key performance metrics such as First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) to enhance performance and user experience.

3. **Edge Rendering & SSR Optimization**
   - Utilize edge networks and server-side rendering to deliver faster, location-based responses. Understand the benefits and implementation strategies for edge rendering and SSR.

4. **Design Systems & Component Libraries**
   - Implement reusable UI components at scale using tools like Storybook and design tokens. Learn how to create and maintain design systems to ensure consistency across all parts of an application.

5. **Monorepo Management**
   - Organize and manage complex codebases efficiently using monorepo tools like Nx or Turborepo. Understand the benefits of monorepos for large-scale projects and how to set them up.

6. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Techniques**
   - Enhance web applications with PWA techniques such as service workers, offline caching, and background sync. Learn how to create richer and faster user experiences with PWAs.

7. **Advanced State Management**
   - Master advanced state management solutions, including global state management, context isolation, and lazy-loaded reducers. Tools like Redux Toolkit will be essential for this.

8. **Security Practices**
   - Implement robust security practices including Content Security Policy (CSP), secure authentication mechanisms, and mitigation techniques for vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

9. **Advanced Testing Frameworks**
   - Use advanced testing frameworks such as Cypress or Playwright for component-level testing, visual regression testing, and integration testing. Ensure your applications are thoroughly tested and reliable.

10. **Automated CI/CD Pipelines**
    - Integrate automated CI/CD pipelines into your front-end development workflow. Automate testing, bundling, and deployment processes to streamline development and ensure consistent quality.
